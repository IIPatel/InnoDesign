# AI Product Design and Development Tool

## Overview

This repository contains a **Streamlit app** that leverages generative AI for **product design and development**. The app provides a powerful tool for designers to generate product concepts, simulate their performance, and optimize them for manufacturability using AI models from **IBM WatsonX** and **IBM Granite** for text-based design suggestions.

### Key Features
- **AI-Generated Product Designs:** Input specifications and receive detailed design concepts.
- **Continuous Querying:** Users can refine their designs through iterative AI queries.
- **Simulation and Optimization:** Suggest design optimizations for cost, materials, and manufacturability.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Leverage IBM WatsonX models for text-based design narratives.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python** 
- **Streamlit**
- **IBM WatsonX**
